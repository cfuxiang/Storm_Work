# Storm Work & Tutorials

In the initial commit, there are 4 different applications

1. a mobile call log analyser
2. usage of trident
3. reading tweets
	
	-currently revoked api access (use your own access!)
	-keys are supplied manually through application invocation
	-remember to check & start zookeeper, nimbus & supervisor (in case they have been d/c previously)
	
4. reading yahoo finance

All the code listed here are compilable in my machine. If you have any issues in compiling/running them, create an issue in the github repository and let me know.

More applications to be added in subsequent pushes...
